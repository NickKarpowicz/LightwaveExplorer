### Changes in 2025.4:
Bug fix release:
- Corrects the carrier-envelope phase unit on the GUI
- Fixes batch size of 1 refusing to run
- Fixes a crash when rendering large 2D beam views
- Fixes a crash in FDTD mode for large grids and short time lengths
- Fixes GUI lock-up when rendering large beam views

### Changes in 2025.3:
- Add polarizer() sequence function
- Use OneMath 0.7 in SYCL version

### Changes in 2025.2:
- Added new beam visualization mode, where you can make color images of the light field that results from the simulation
- Add new controls for the appearance of plots, which you can access by clicking the ↔️ button on the bottom of the window.
- Fixed a bug where a FROG file loaded for pulse 2 wouldn't be used.
- Fixed a bug where very large grids whose dimensions were divisible by 4 but not by 8 would look weird.
- The LightwaveExplorer python module is now on pip! i.e. you can run "pip install LightwaveExplorer" to get the latest version.

### Changes in 2025.1:
- Fixed a bug introduced in 2025.0 where on CUDA the plasma would not affect fields in the y-direction
- Fixed a bug where cancelling a batch job caused the subsequent batch to cancel itself
- Axes and scales are now shown on the space and momentum images, and they're also saved when an SVG is produced.
- Plot font size scaling works better with high-DPI displays
- Refactored device structures to more efficiently and consistently allocate memory
- NOTE: to read the files produced with 2025.0 and later in python, you need to update the LightwaveExplorer module (now available on pip!), many thanks to Florian Lindinger for the improved version that works with new and old files!

### Changes in 2025.0:

 - FDTD mode is more accessible: besides the options for crystals in the Propagation pulldown menu, you can also load a custom grid containing different nonlinear materials at different positions using the fdtd() function
 - FDTD reflection mode for nonlinear reflection from a surface, using the fdtdReflection() sequence command.
 - Improved convergence for the nonlinear absorption/plasma response. Note that the changes I made here will re-scale the values of the nonlinear absorption parameter (now they are consistent with what was in the paper). The conversion factor for older values is $\left(\frac{1}{2\pi\epsilon_0}\right)^{\frac{1}{N_p-1}}$ where $N_p$ is the number of photons in the multiphoton transition (divide the old value by this number).
