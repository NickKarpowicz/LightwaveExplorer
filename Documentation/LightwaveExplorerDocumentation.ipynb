    "### What and why\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightwave explorer is an open source nonlinear optics simulator, intended to be fast, visual, and flexible for students and researchers to play with ultrashort laser pulses and nonlinear optics without having to buy a laser first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation itself is written in CUDA in order to run on graphics cards. This makes it fast enough to give almost instant feedback to the user, which can hopefully make it easier to develop that nebulous but important \"feeling\" for how things fit together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although its target platform is the GPU, I've written it in a \"bilingual\" pattern of CUDA so that exactly the same code can be compiled as c++ to run on the CPU. A CPU will not be nearly as fast as a GPU, about an order of magnitude slower, in my experience. However, since one of the goals of this project was for the results we publish to be fully transparent and reproducible, I think it's important that as many people as possible have access to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main goals:\n",
    " - _Easily extensible database of materials:_ Eveything the program knows about nonlinear materials comes from a human-readable text file giving the appropriate coefficients and tensors. If you want to use a new material, or you've done a measurement in a new range where typical extrapolations from older data isn't relevant, it's easy to add and correct. There are places for references for the key parameters, and these references are stored in the saved simulation results for future reference. Especially if you have simulations that you checked against experiments, I'd be very happy for you to add your crystal definitions to the central database in the project Github.\n",
    " - _Efficient code so that complicated systems can be simulated in 3D:_ Real laser pulses can be messy, and if they weren't so before a nonlinear crystal, there's a good chance they are after (but not always). If things are slow, it's hard to go beyond one dimension on tolerable time scales, and then you miss out on the whole weird world of spatiotemporal couplings. Here you have options for rather fast simulations when there's a symmetry to apply (e.g. cylindrical or along one Cartesian dimension), alongside fully 3D propagation. Runs natively on both GPU and CPU to make use of whatever you have to work with.\n",
    " - _A graphical interface that lets you see what you're doing:_ A lot of us think in visual terms. Being able to adjust and scan parameters and immediately see what happens can really make it easier to understand what you're looking at. \n",
    " - _A flexible sequence mode:_ By stringing together elements, not just nonlinear crystals but also spherical or parabolic mirrors, apertures, filters, free space propagation and other elements, simulate how  one interaction affects another. Sequences of events can be scripted and even programmed with loop functions to see how things change over the course of repeated interactions.\n",
    " - _Fitting modes:_ Sometimes the data that we measure depends on an interesting way on a parameter, and we'd actually like to go back and figure out what that parameter was from the data. Solving this kind of inverse problem can be tough when the parameter lives inside a partial differential equation, but by simulating the whole thing and doing a fit, you have a chance to do it! The fitting algorithm can be used to narrow down a huge space of variables to come at your best estimation of what was happening in an experiment, or to adjust your experimental system to maximize output at a given frequency.\n",
    " - _A Python module for easy postprocessing of the results:_ I hope that you get something interesting out that you want to plot and maybe publish. One of the nicest platforms for making nice plots is Python in my opinion (that's why this documentation is in a Jupyter notebook), so purely out of self interest I tried to make it easy to load the results in Python. The module also has some functions related to typical operations you'd like to do on the data to make it easy for all of us. The program also gives you a Matlab loading script for those who want to use that.\n",
    " - _Command line interface for running on Linux/clusters:_ The main application runs on Windows, but the simulation core can be compiled on Linux. I use this to run it on the clusters of the Max Planck Society, and other institutes and universities likely have similar systems. This lets you do a lot more if your personal resources are limited but you want to run simulations on a large grid or cover a lot of different parameters!\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Libraries used\n",
    " For some of the mathematical operations, I use the following libraries. Thanks to the original authors for making their work available! In order to compile Lightwave Explorer, you'll need them. They are all freely available, but of course have their own licenses .etc.\n",
    "  - [NVIDIA CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit): This provides the basic CUDA runtime, compiler, and cuFFT (which does the Fourier transforms here).\n",
    "  - [Intel OneAPI](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/overview.html), specifically the [Math Kernel Library](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html#gs.cw3ci4): This is used for performing fast fourier transforms when running in CPU mode. Unfortunately the performance isn't great on non-Intel processors, but I couldn't use the FFTW library if I want to make the compiled executables available, since it is licensed under GPL 3.0, and I'm also using CUDA, whose runtime is propreitary.\n",
    "  - [Dlib](http://dlib.net/): This library is the basis of the optimization routines. I make use of the global optimization functions for the fitting/optimization modes. The library is [available on Github](https://github.com/davisking/dlib), and their excellent documentation and further information is on the [main project website](http://dlib.net/).\n"

    "#### Basic equations\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm sure we've all derived the wave equation from Maxwell's equations before, so I'm not going to repeat that. Let's just talk about the equations I'm using and where they come from.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final version there will be two main modes, one based on the wave equation in the paraxial approximation, where we make a simplification based on the assumption that the light is moving primarily along a given direction, and the full solution of Maxwell's equations on a grid. Right now the latter isn't available yet! But in the vast majority of cases, the former is what you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nonlinear, unidirectional wave equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} E(\\mathbf{x} ,\\omega) = i(k_z + \\frac{1}{2k_z}\\nabla^2_\\perp)E(\\mathbf{x} ,\\omega) + \\frac{i\\omega}{2\\epsilon_0 \\tilde{n}\\left(\\omega\\right)c}\\mathbf{P}^{\\mathrm{NL}}\\left(\\mathbf{x},\\omega\\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where propagation of the field is assumed to be primarily along the $z$ axis. $\\nabla^2_\\perp$ is the transverse Laplacian (_e.g._ $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}$ in Cartesian coordinates). $\\omega$ is the angular frequency (this equation is in the frequency domain), $\\mathbf{P}^{NL}$ is the nonlinear polarization, $\\tilde{n}$ is the complex index of refraction, and the other constants have their usual definition. Bold $\\mathbf{x}$ is shorthand for either $x$, $y$, and $z$ in Cartesian coordinates, or $\\rho$, $\\theta$, and $z$ in cylindrical coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In deriving this equation, we make the assumption that $\\left|k_z^2\\right| \\gg \\left|\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} \\tilde{A}(z)\\right|$, where $\\tilde{A}$ is the complex amplitude of a given frequency component of the electric field. This means that we are assuming that the field evolves gradually on the spatial scale of the wavelength. This is a good assumption when the light is propagating in the presence of \"normal\" nonlinearities, where the nonlinear signal builds up slowly over time. It's not a good assumption near interfaces, where the reflection from the surface suddenly changes the evolution of the wave, and there is a counterpropagting wave. So, for thin crystals, or surface nonlinearities, we'll want to fully solve Maxwell's equations (which will be implemented later). You'll notice that the spatial form of this equation is pretty similar to the Helmholtz equation. The underlying assumptions are quite similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\mathbf{P}^{NL} = 0$, we have linear propagation of light, and for example a Gaussian beam is a solution to the above equation. When it's nonzero is when things get interesting. We'll go over how that happens in a bit."

You're not expected to use all of them, they're just there to make it more likely that it can accommodate any equation you find in literature, containing common forms of various elements.

To extend this to higher order nonlinearities, the pattern is identical, but the numbered indicies extend up to higher numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Miller's rule strictly speaking is the case up to 3. The higher the nonlinearity, the more likely one is to have components close to resonances, where things can go wrong: for example, infrared-active phonon modes will affect $\\chi^{(3)}$, instead of the Raman-active ones. For calculating resonant behavior, a different calculation should be added to the nonlinear polarization tailored to the specific problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the applied nonlinearities are not instantaneous: the response to a $\\delta$-function excitation will not be another $\\delta$-function. Practically, this helps avoid overestimates e.g. of infrared nonlinearities based on coefficients taken from visible measurements. It also means that when configuring a crystal, you need to supply the frequencies at which the measurement that provided the elements of the nonlinear tensor was performed. Without these, the response _will_ be treated as instantaneous."

This method is not unconditionally stable, which means that for certain values of the grid parameters, the results will diverge, and lead to NaN values. The simulation will quit if this happens, and tell you. In order to avoid this, you have to set the grid spacing parameters correctly, this means the time step, spatial step and propagation step.\n",

    "Although the specifics of how these schemes become unstable are well understood (see the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy Condition), in practice it's usually best to progressively make your steps smaller until you get a result, then to continue to make them smaller until nothing changes. Due to the 4th order convergence of the algorithm used, typically once a result appears, it will be close to convergence already. This is why I actually prefer this over unconditionally-stable algorithms: those give results which _look_ valid, but are not, while RK4 tends to simply explode instead of giving something that's wrong.\n",

    "\n",
    "Compared to a Cartesian coordinate, we have an extra term to deal with. And unfortunately, unlike Cartesian coordinates, that term is not a diagonal operator in the Fourier domain.\n",

    "One approach is to make a Hankel transform instead of a Fourier transform, in which case the operator will be diagonal. Numerically this can be implemented in a fairly efficient way leveraging FFTs, but only if the data is arranged on a logarithmic grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way is to use an evenly spaced grid, but explicitly calculate the $\\frac{1}{\\rho}$ term in real space. This way one uses FFTs and the same grid as the calculations in Cartesian coordinates, but with the expense of having to do a Fourier transform at each propagation step. Since we have to do that anyway for the inclusion of nonlinearities, it's not a big deal in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid used in this case extends to the negative side of the origin, so that the FFT doesn't see a discontinuity at $\\rho = 0$, covering the range $-\\rho_{\\textrm{max}}$ to $+\\rho_{\\textrm{max}}$. This would seem to be a waste of memory since the positive and negative sides of the origin are identical by symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use a grid that is truly symmetric, that is indeed the case: we would be solving everything at $\\rho = ... -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3...$ etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what if we shift the placement of our grid points by $\\frac{1}{4}$? Now we have the fields at $\\rho = ... -2\\frac{3}{4}, -1\\frac{3}{4}, -\\frac{3}{4}, +\\frac{1}{4}, +1\\frac{1}{4}, +2\\frac{1}{4}, +3\\frac{1}{4}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the positive and negative sides of the grid have different information: the previously-useless negative-$\\rho$ values contain the midpoints between the points on the positive $\\rho$ grid. The spacing is still 1 however, meaning that the grid doesn't include high values of the transverse $k$, which often bring numerical instability, in order to get doubled resolution in space. We just have to \"interlace\" the grid using our knowledge of the symmetry of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "We make use of this in two places in the cylindrical symmetry propagation mode: to eliminate _aliasing_ in the calculation of the nonlinear polarization, and to improve the accuracy of the finite-difference calculation of the radial derivative included in that $\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\rho}$ term of the Laplacian.\n",

    "Here's an example of a sequence making use of loops in order so simulate a periodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN) crystal, with two different periods along the propagation direction:\n",

    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through what the different terms mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we have the set() function. This is defined further below, but in short it allows you to assign a value to a variable. You can access up to 100 variables (named v0 to v99) if you want to - which one you access is the first parameter in the function call. The second parameter of the call is what you set it to. So in this case, we are setting the variable v1 to 14.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have a for loop. The syntax of a for loop takes two parameters: first, the number of iterations, second, the variable in which to store the counter. This for loop will loop over 0.5*500/v1 iterations, which means that it is reading the variable set in the previous line (v1) to determine how many times to run. This is so the loop can run over a fixed PPLN thickness instead of a fixed number of periods. The variable v0 will contain the index of the for loop (i.e. how many times it has run, starting from 0). This isn't used here, but could for example be used to make a chirped PPLN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have the nonlinear() function. This runs the nonlinear propagation, as given in the function definition below. You might notice that a lot of the parameters just have 'd' instead of a number. This tells the interpreter just to take the default value of the parameter, i.e. to take the value given by the interface. Any value with d will be able to be scanned in a batch mode or changed by the fitting routine, as it will be tied to the currently active value.\n",

They are called by the letter i followed by a number, where the number is the identifier of the associated batch mode. That is, the number you can see in the pull-down menu when selecting which parameter to scan for a batch. So, for example, i01 will give you the pulse energy in Joules. Setting the length of a crystal to i34^2 will cause its length to be the square of the length (in microns) as entered on the interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently the values of the iXX variables cannot be changed from within the sequence. They might do so if I can convince myself it won't lead to any disasters.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### vXX\n",
    "These are user-controlled variables. You can set them to whatever you want with the set() function: set(2,i34) will set the value of v02 to the length of the crystal. You can use them later to determine input parameters of functions. They start with their values initialized to zero, so that's what they'll be if you use them without setting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### d\n",
    "The keyword d will set the input parameter of a function to the corresponding value of the interface. If you call a nonlinear crystal with nonlinear(d,d,d,d,d), its material index, $\\theta$, $\\phi$, thickness and propagation step will just be whatever is on the interface, after being potentially modified by a batch scan or fitting command.\n",
