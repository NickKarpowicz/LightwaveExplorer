    "#### Basic equations: The unidirectional propagation equation\n",
    "I'm sure we've all derived the wave equation from Maxwell's equations before, so I'm not going to repeat that. Let's just talk about the equations I'm using and where they come from.\n",
    "\n",
    "In LWE, there are two modes of propagation. The most commonly-used is the nonlinear, unidirectional wave equation, which has a typical form like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} E(\\mathbf{x} ,\\omega) = i(k + \\frac{1}{2k}\\nabla^2_\\perp)E(\\mathbf{x} ,\\omega) + \\frac{i\\omega}{2\\epsilon_0 \\tilde{n}\\left(\\omega\\right)c}\\mathbf{P}^{\\mathrm{NL}}\\left(\\mathbf{x},\\omega\\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where propagation of the field is assumed to be primarily along the $z$ axis. $\\nabla^2_\\perp$ is the transverse Laplacian (_e.g._ $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}$ in Cartesian coordinates). $\\omega$ is the angular frequency (this equation is in the frequency domain), $\\mathbf{P}^{NL}$ is the nonlinear polarization, $\\tilde{n}$ is the complex index of refraction, and the other constants have their usual definition. Bold $\\mathbf{x}$ is shorthand for either $x$, $y$, and $z$ in Cartesian coordinates, or $\\rho$, $\\theta$, and $z$ in cylindrical coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In deriving this equation, we make the assumption that $\\left|k_z^2\\right| \\gg \\left|\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} \\tilde{A}(z)\\right|$, where $\\tilde{A}$ is the complex amplitude of a given frequency component of the electric field. This means that we are assuming that the field evolves gradually on the spatial scale of the wavelength. This is a good assumption when the light is propagating in the presence of \"normal\" nonlinearities, where the nonlinear signal builds up slowly over time. It's not a good assumption near interfaces, where the reflection from the surface suddenly changes the evolution of the wave, and there is a counterpropagting wave. So, for thin crystals, or surface nonlinearities, we'll want to fully solve Maxwell's equations. You'll notice that the spatial form of this equation looks like the Helmholtz equation. The underlying assumptions are quite similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\mathbf{P}^{NL} = 0$, we have linear propagation of light, and for example a Gaussian beam is a solution to the above equation. When it's nonzero is when things get interesting. We'll go over how that happens in a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic equations: Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)\n",
    "\n",
    "The other propagation mode we can use is FDTD mode, where Maxwell's equations are solved on a grid. This mode doesn't use the paraxial or slowly-evolving wave equations used in the unidirectional propagation equation above. This gives us a few things: effects at interfaces are handled more correctly, and we can simulate etalon effects inside of crystals (where the light makes multiple reflections inside, resulting in a modulated transmission vs. frequency).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this mode, we don't need to derive much, we just start with two equations from Maxwell. Specifically,\n",

    "These are just two coupled first-order partial differential equations. We have both quantities $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ definied on a grid in space, and these quantities advance over time. If something interesting is happening, there will also be a material, whose response to the field is $\\mathbf{J}$. The physical model in the basic version of LWE for calculating the current is in the form of a series of Lorentzian oscillators. Their basic equations of motion look like this when we're dealing with the linear response:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{J}}{\\partial t} = k_L \\mathbf{E} - \\gamma \\mathbf{J} - \\omega_0^2 \\mathbf{P}\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{P}}{\\partial t} = \\mathbf{J}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k_L = \\frac{Ne^2}{m_e}$ is the strength of the response depending of the density of dipoles N and their charge and mass, $\\gamma$ describes the relaxation rate of the oscillator and $\\omega_0$ is its resonance frequency. So now we have two more coupled, first-order partial differential equations. Since the first one contains $\\mathbf{E}$ as a driving term, inside of the material, all of our equations are coupled together! When we start doing nonlinear optics, we just have to modify the driving term to make use of the nonlinear tensor (plus some additional bookkeeping if we're modeling the material's response with an instantaneous component).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that there are more quantities to take care of when we solve Maxwell's equations for our field. Even if we only want $\\mathbf{E}$, we also have to keep track of $\\mathbf{B}$, as well as $\\mathbf{J}$ and $\\mathbf{P}$ for *each* resonance that makes up the material response.\n"

The higher the nonlinearity, the more likely one is to have components close to resonances, where things can go wrong: for example, infrared-active phonon modes will affect $\\chi^{(3)}$, instead of the Raman-active ones. For calculating resonant behavior, a different calculation should be added to the nonlinear polarization tailored to the specific problem.\n",

Practically, this helps avoid overestimates e.g. of infrared nonlinearities based on coefficients taken from visible measurements. It also means that when configuring a crystal, you need to supply the frequencies at which the measurement that provided the elements of the nonlinear tensor was performed. Without these, the response _will_ be treated as instantaneous."

The former is straight-forward: in Ampere's law, we just replace $\\epsilon_0$ with $\\epsilon_0\\epsilon_\\infty$. The rest of the response, including all of the nonlinear optical responses, comes through $\\mathbf{J}$, and requires more care.\n",

    "The numerical propagation is performed using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. This method is not unconditionally stable, which means that for certain values of the grid parameters, the results will diverge, and lead to NaN values. The simulation will quit if this happens, and tell you. In order to avoid this, you have to set the grid spacing parameters correctly, this means the time step, spatial step and propagation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the specifics of how these schemes become unstable are well understood (see the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy Condition), in practice it's usually best to progressively make your steps smaller until you get a result, then to continue to make them smaller until nothing changes. \n",

    "\\nabla^2_\\perp = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\rho^2} + \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\rho} \\tag{4}\n",
    "\\end{equation}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to a Cartesian coordinate, we have an extra term to deal with. And unfortunately, unlike Cartesian coordinates, that term is not a diagonal operator in the Fourier domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is to make a Hankel transform instead of a Fourier transform, in which case the operator will be diagonal. Numerically this can be implemented in a fairly efficient way leveraging FFTs, but only if the data is arranged on a logarithmic grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way is to use an evenly spaced grid, but explicitly calculate the $\\frac{1}{\\rho}$ term in real space. This way one uses FFTs and the same grid as the calculations in Cartesian coordinates, but with the expense of having to do a Fourier transform at each propagation step. Since we have to do that anyway for the inclusion of nonlinearities, it's not a big deal in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid used in this case extends to the negative side of the origin, so that the FFT doesn't see a discontinuity at $\\rho = 0$, covering the range $-\\rho_{\\textrm{max}}$ to $+\\rho_{\\textrm{max}}$. This would seem to be a waste of memory since the positive and negative sides of the origin are identical by symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use a grid that is truly symmetric, that is indeed the case: we would be solving everything at $\\rho = ... -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3...$ etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what if we shift the placement of our grid points by $\\frac{1}{4}$? Now we have the fields at $\\rho = ... -2\\frac{3}{4}, -1\\frac{3}{4}, -\\frac{3}{4}, +\\frac{1}{4}, +1\\frac{1}{4}, +2\\frac{1}{4}, +3\\frac{1}{4}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the positive and negative sides of the grid have different information: the previously-useless negative-$\\rho$ values contain the midpoints between the points on the positive $\\rho$ grid. The spacing is still 1 however, meaning that the grid doesn't include high values of the transverse $k$, which often bring numerical instability, in order to get doubled resolution in space. We just have to \"interlace\" the grid using our knowledge of the symmetry of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "We make use of this in two places in the cylindrical symmetry propagation mode: to eliminate _aliasing_ in the calculation of the nonlinear polarization, and to improve the accuracy of the finite-difference calculation of the radial derivative included in that $\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\rho}$ term of the Laplacian.\n",

    "### Pulse parameters\n",
    "These you find in two columns on the left. Here you can put in all the parameters described in the Pulse Parameters section, plus a few more.\n",
    "1. Pulse energy: total energy contained in the pulse; the intensity will be determined by this value\n",
    "2. Frequency: $f_0$ as defined above, in THz\n",
    "3. Bandwidth: $\\Delta_\\omega$ as defined above, in THz\n",
    "4. SG order: $N_s$ as defined above, giving the order of the supergaussian to use. 2 is a normal gaussian. Only even values are allowed.\n",
    "5. CEP/$\\pi$: $\\phi_0$ as defined above, the carrier-envelope phase. In units of radians/$\\pi$, e.g. a value of 1 will invert the field.\n",
    "6. Delay: $tau$, in fs. Allows you to move your pulse around the grid - negative values move it earlier in time.\n",
    "7. GDD: $\\phi_2$, the group delay dispersion, in fs $^2$\n",
    "7. GDD: $\\phi_3$, the third order dispersion, in fs $^3$\n",
    "8. Phase material: You can select from the loaded material in the crystal database, shown in the info box, a material whose dispersion you would like to apply to the pulse. For example, if you leave it as 2, it will apply the phase of passing through BaF2.\n",
    "9. Thickness: Thickness in microns of the phase material to apply. If you set it to 1000, the pulse will be stretched (or compressed) as though it passed through 1 mm of barium fluoride. Negative values would allow you to precompensate for the dispersion.\n",
    "10. Beamwaist: The Gaussian waist $w_o$. This is not necessarily the size of the beam at the start of the simulation, but what size the focus will have when the beam reaches in via linear propagation.\n",
    "11. x offset: amount by which to shift the beam on the spatial grid. Will always be 0 when radial symmetry is applied.\n",
    "12. z offset: amount by which to shift the beam relative to the propagation coordinate. 0 means that the beam is focused at the beginning of the simulation. If it is negative, it will be diverging as the simulation starts, and if it's positive, it will be converging.\n",
    "13. NC angle: Noncollinear angle of the beam. If it is 0, the beam will be pointing along the z-axis.\n",
    "14. Polarization: Angle in degrees of the field direction relative to the x-y plane. 0 means the field is along the x axis, 90 means it is along the y axis.\n",
    "15. Circularity: degree of ellipticity of the field. 0 means linearly polarized, 1 means circular.\n",

    "#### Grid parameters\n",
    "These describe the propagation space of the pulse.\n",

    "1. Material index: first column is the number of the material (from the list of loaded database entries displayed in the info box when the program starts). Second column is an alternate material to be applied in certain special modes.\n",
    "2. Theta, phi: the crystal propagation angles in degrees. They select the phase matching and nonlinear coefficients of the interaction.\n",
    "3. NL absorption: The parameters describing the nonlinear absorption; $\\beta$ (in units determined by the order of the interaction), and $\\Delta_g$ (in eV).\n",
    "4. Drude model parameters: the momentum relaxation time $\\gamma$ and the reduced effective mass $\\mu$\n",
    "5. Grid width, dx: the size and resolution of the spatial grid, respectively. In microns.\n",
    "6. Time span, dt: The length and resolution of the temporal grid, in fs.\n",
    "7. Length, dz: How far to propagate, and the spatial step size of the simulation, in microns.\n",
    "8. Propagation mode: select between full 3D, radial symmetry mode, or 2D cartesian coordinates.\n",
    "9. Batch mode: This is a bit complicated, but it allows you to run a sequence of simulations, sweeping one variable.\n",
    "    - first, select from the drop down the parameter you wish to change. The pulse and material properties you set with floating point values are all adjustable here.\n",
    "    - in \"batch end\" put the value to which it should sweep, in the same units as the initial value you gave. For example, if \"Delay\" on the left-hand-side of the interface is set to \"-50\", and you put \"50\" in the \"Batch end\" box, the series will go from -50 to 50.\n",
    "    - in Batch steps, put the number of steps in the sweep. If it is 1, only the initial value will be used. If it is zero or less, it will set itself to 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can program a variety of things to happen, and utilize for loops and variables to simulated complicated systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is similar to c/c++ - you can write out a series of functions, applying white space as you see fit. Semicolons are not necessary after function calls, but you can add them if you want. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a sequence making use of loops in order so simulate a periodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN) crystal, with two different periods along the propagation direction:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    set(1,14.6)\n",
    "    for(0.5*500/v01,0){\n",
    "        nonlinear(d,d,d,v1,d)\n",
    "        rotate(180)\n",

    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through what the different terms mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we have the set() function. This is defined further below, but in short it allows you to assign a value to a variable. You can access up to 100 variables (named v00 to v99) if you want to - which one you access is the first parameter in the function call. The second parameter of the call is what you set it to. So in this case, we are setting the variable v01 to 14.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have a for loop. The syntax of a for loop takes two parameters: first, the number of iterations, second, the variable in which to store the counter. This for loop will loop over 0.5*500/v1 iterations, which means that it is reading the variable set in the previous line (v1) to determine how many times to run. This is so the loop can run over a fixed PPLN thickness instead of a fixed number of periods. The variable v0 will contain the index of the for loop (i.e. how many times it has run, starting from 0). This isn't used here, but could for example be used to make a chirped PPLN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have the nonlinear() function. This runs the nonlinear propagation, as given in the function definition below. You might notice that a lot of the parameters just have 'd' instead of a number. This tells the interpreter just to take the default value of the parameter, i.e. to take the value given by the interface. Any value with d will be able to be scanned in a batch mode or changed by the fitting routine, as it will be tied to the currently active value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following that is the rotate() function, which rotates the field relative to the crystal. From the field's point-of-view, it's like the orientation of the crystal was flipped upside down, allowing quasi-phasematching to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The for loop is then closed by curly brackets, and another one starts, doing the same thing, over 17 iterations with half-period of 9.25 microns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of variables that can be accessed: iXX, vXX and d.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### iXX\n",
    "These are interface variables, which correspond to the parameters that are set by the interface. They are called by the letter i followed by a number, where the number is the identifier of the associated batch mode. That is, the number you can see in the pull-down menu when selecting which parameter to scan for a batch. So, for example, i01 will give you the pulse energy in Joules. Setting the length of a crystal to i34^2 will cause its length to be the square of the length (in microns) as entered on the interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently the values of the iXX variables cannot be changed from within the sequence. They might do so if I can convince myself it won't lead to any disasters.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### vXX\n",
    "These are user-controlled variables. You can set them to whatever you want with the set() function: set(2,i34) will set the value of v02 to the length of the crystal. You can use them later to determine input parameters of functions. They start with their values initialized to zero, so that's what they'll be if you use them without setting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### d\n",
    "The keyword d will set the input parameter of a function to the corresponding value of the interface. If you call a nonlinear crystal with nonlinear(d,d,d,d,d), its material index, $\\theta$, $\\phi$, thickness and propagation step will just be whatever is on the interface, after being potentially modified by a batch scan or fitting command.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that compared to the interface, you have an extra beam angle and beam position. These are only relevant to 3D calculations and gives the angle and offset in the y-direction. (you can actually specify them on the interface, too, by writing both angles in the text box separated by a semicolon in the box for x0 and the NC angle, e.g. 10;20 will give an x-direction value of 10 and a y-direction value of 20).\n",

    "#### linear(materialIndex, crystalTheta, crystalPhi, crystalThickness, propagationStep)\n",
    "This function will propagate *linearly* through the medium determined by materialIndex. The parameter propagationStep is only necessary when in cylindrical symmetry mode. This is because the propagation is carried out analytically in 3D and 2D Cartesian modes since the linear propagator is diagonal in those bases. In cylindrical symmetry mode, it is handled as a numerical propagation with all nonlinearities disabled, which is why specifying a step size is necessary. This is also why this function is significantly faster in 3D and 2D Cartesian coordinates.\n",

It essentially provides the effect of allowing the field to propagate into the far field, and selecting a conical section of the light determined by the angles openingAngle (e.g. the apex angle of the cone) and the two angles alphaX and alphaY which give its orientation relative to the propagation axis.
