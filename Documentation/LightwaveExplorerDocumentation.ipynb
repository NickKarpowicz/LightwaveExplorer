    "## What and why\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightwave explorer is an open source nonlinear optics simulator, intended to be fast, visual, and flexible for students and researchers to play with ultrashort laser pulses and nonlinear optics without having to buy a laser first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation itself is written in CUDA in order to run on graphics cards. This makes it fast enough to give almost instant feedback to the user, which can hopefully make it easier to develop that nebulous but important \"feeling\" for how things fit together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although its target platform is the GPU, I've written it in a \"bilingual\" pattern of CUDA so that exactly the same code can be compiled as c++ to run on the CPU. A CPU will not be nearly as fast as a GPU, about an order of magnitude in my experience. However, since one of the goals of this project was for the results we publish to be fully transparent and reproducible, I think it's important that as many people as possible have access to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main goals:\n",
    " - _Easily extensible database of materials:_ Eveything the program knows about nonlinear materials comes from a human-readable text file giving the appropriate coefficients and tensors. If you want to use a new material, or you've done a measurement in a new range where typical extrapolations from older data isn't relevant, it's easy to add and correct. There are places for references for the key parameters, and these references are stored in the saved simulation results for future reference. Especially if you have simulations that you checked against experiments, I'd be very happy for you to add your crystal definitions to the central database in the project Github.\n",
    " - _Efficient code so that complicated systems can be simulated in 3D:_ Real laser pulses can be messy, and if they weren't so before a nonlinear crystal, there's a good chance they are after (but not always). If things are slow, it's hard to go beyond one dimension on tolerable time scales, and then you miss out on the whole weird world of spatiotemporal couplings. Here you have options for rather fast simulations when there's a symmetry to apply (e.g. cylindrical or along one Cartesian dimension), alongside fully 3D propagation. Runs natively on both GPU and CPU to make use of whatever you have to work with.\n",
    " - _A graphical interface that lets you see what you're doing:_ A lot of us think in visual terms. Being able to adjust and scan parameters and immediately see what happens can really make it easier to understand what you're looking at. \n",
    " - _A flexible sequence mode:_ By stringing together elements, not just nonlinear crystals but also spherical or parabolic mirrors, apertures, filters, free space propagation and other elements, simulate how  one interaction affects another. Sequences of events can be scripted and even programmed with loop functions to see how things change over the course of repeated interactions.\n",
    " - _Fitting modes:_ Sometimes the data that we measure depends on an interesting way on a parameter, and we'd actually like to go back and figure out what that parameter was from the data. Solving this kind of inverse problem can be tough when the parameter lives inside a partial differential equation, but by simulating the whole thing and doing a fit, you have a chance to do it! The fitting algorithm can be used to narrow down a huge space of variables to come at your best estimation of what was happening in an experiment, or to adjust your experimental system to maximize output at a given frequency.\n",
    " - _A Python module for easy postprocessing of the results:_ I hope that you get something interesting out that you want to plot and maybe publish. One of the nicest platforms for making nice plots is Python in my opinion (that's why this documentation is in a Jupyter notebook), so purely out of self interest I tried to make it easy to load the results in Python. The module also has some functions related to typical operations you'd like to do on the data to make it easy for all of us. The program also gives you a Matlab loading script for those who want to use that.\n",
    " - _Command line interface for running on Linux/clusters:_ The main application runs on Windows, but the simulation core can be compiled on Linux. I use this to run it on the clusters of the Max Planck Society, and other institutes and universities likely have similar systems. This lets you do a lot more if your personal resources are limited but you want to run simulations on a large grid or cover a lot of different parameters!\n"

    "I'm sure we've all derived the wave equation from Maxwell's equations before, so I'm not going to repeat that. Let's just talk about the equations I'm using and where they come from.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final version there will be two main modes, one based on the wave equation in the paraxial approximation, where we make a simplification based on the assumption that the light is moving primarily along a given direction, and the full solution of Maxwell's equations on a grid. Right now the latter isn't available yet! But in the vast majority of cases, the former is what you want to use.\n",

    "The nonlinear, unidirectional wave equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} E(\\mathbf{x} ,\\omega) = i(k_z + \\frac{1}{2k_z}\\nabla^2_\\perp)E(\\mathbf{x} ,\\omega) + \\frac{i\\omega}{2\\epsilon_0 \\tilde{n}\\left(\\omega\\right)c}\\mathbf{P}^{\\mathrm{NL}}\\left(\\mathbf{x},\\omega\\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where propagation of the field is assumed to be primarily along the $z$ axis. $\\nabla^2_\\perp$ is the transverse Laplacian (_e.g._ $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}$ in Cartesian coordinates). $\\omega$ is the angular frequency (this equation is in the frequency domain), $\\mathbf{P}^{NL}$ is the nonlinear polarization, $\\tilde{n}$ is the complex index of refraction, and the other constants have their usual definition. Bold $\\mathbf{x}$ is shorthand for either $x$, $y$, and $z$ in Cartesian coordinates, or $\\rho$, $\\theta$, and $z$ in cylindrical coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In deriving this equation, we make the assumption that $\\left|k_z^2\\right| \\gg \\left|\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} \\tilde{A}(z)\\right|$, where $\\tilde{A}$ is the complex amplitude of a given frequency component of the electric field. This means that we are assuming that the field evolves gradually on the spatial scale of the wavelength. This is a good assumption when the light is propagating in the presence of \"normal\" nonlinearities, where the nonlinear signal builds up slowly over time. It's not a good assumption near interfaces, where the reflection from the surface suddenly changes the evolution of the wave, and there is a counterpropagting wave. So, for thin crystals, or surface nonlinearities, we'll want to fully solve Maxwell's equations (which will be implemented later). You'll notice that the spatial form of this equation is pretty similar to the Helmholtz equation. The underlying assumptions are quite similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\mathbf{P}^{NL} = 0$, we have linear propagation of light, and for example a Gaussian beam is a solution to the above equation. When it's nonzero is when things get interesting. We'll go over how that happens in a bit."

    "\n",
    "Another way is to use an evenly spaced grid, but explicitly calculate the $\\frac{1}{\\rho}$ term in real space. This way one uses FFTs and the same grid as the calculations in Cartesian coordinates, but with the expense of having to do a Fourier transform at each propagation step. Since we have to do that anyway for the inclusion of nonlinearities, it's not a big deal in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid used in this case extends to the negative side of the origin, so that the FFT doesn't see a discontinuity at $\\rho = 0$, covering the range $-\\rho_{\\textrm{max}}$ to $+\\rho_{\\textrm{max}}$. This would seem to be a waste of memory since the positive and negative sides of the origin are identical by symmetry.\n",

The spacing is still 1 however, meaning that the grid doesn't include high values of the transverse $k$, which often bring numerical instability, in order to get doubled resolution in space. We just have to \"interlace\" the grid using our knowledge of the symmetry of the system. \n",
